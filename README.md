# Minimal reproducer for Carthesian Product error with nvc++

I may have found an error in the nvc++ compiler. It seems that when you use the
carthesian product and mdspan to modify data with par_unseq policy and `-stdpar=gpu|multicore`, you end up with data corruption.
The problem disappear when you use `-nostdpar` or if you use the seq policy.

## Update 10.07

I updated the reproducer with a patch from Nvidia, and the issue is resolved.

## Description

In [main.cpp](main.cpp), we have a sequential reference function and one using the STL and the carthesian product. The other functions are only here for utils (printing and stuff).

## Reproduce the bug

```console
make run
```

## Compiler version

The error is present at least with nvc++ 24.1 and 24.3.

24.1 :
```console
> nvc++ -V

nvc++ 24.1-0 64-bit target on x86-64 Linux -tp haswell 
NVIDIA Compilers and Tools

```

24.3 :
```console
> nvc++ -V

nvc++ 24.3-0 64-bit target on x86-64 Linux -tp haswell
